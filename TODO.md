# TODO

- [ ] add tmp dir caching
- [ ] add dockerfile reconstruction (needs to be build into dockerfile-parser)
- [ ] add config file
- [ ] add git add and push for fixes
- [ ] add simple fix for directory removal or sth...just to check if this approach can actually work well
- [x] add OCI tar parsing
- [ ] OCI image parsing currently reads the file a ton of times...this should be optimized
- [ ] config system
